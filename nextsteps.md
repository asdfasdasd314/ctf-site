# TODO
- **CLEANUP**
    - No stateful usernames or password
    - Remove redundant code
    - What do I need on the page?
    - Bad naming and URLs
- User dashboard
- For Vulnerable Auth challenge, users expire after 20 minutes (except for the ones I put in at the start)
- Backend logic for completing challenges
- No SQL injection
- IP address rate limiting
- Remove the $argoni=2 or whatever in the password hashes because it's just annoying me
